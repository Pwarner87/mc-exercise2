bob & alice rock!
ted & carol sucks!
feature one
this feels so awkward. get a mouse and clean up your setup pronto.


What went wrong was both groups were working on the same branch with different information when they tried to merge. So it was trying to put 2 different lines of code within the same code. A way to remedy this would be for everyone to work on seperate branches.
What we also found what went wrong was trying to commit from the same branch and different work stations. One wa sbehind the other. The way we fixed this was working on different branches.
we also recieved merge conflicts in github, so we had to decide which information we were keeping and change it.
